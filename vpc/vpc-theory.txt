AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) - Comprehensive Guide
1. VPC Basics:🏗️
Definition: A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources like EC2 instances, RDS databases, and more.
Region-Specific: VPCs are regional resources, meaning they exist in a specific AWS region.


2. Subnets:🏝️
Definition: Subnets are divisions within a VPC that help segregate and manage resources. They are associated with a specific Availability Zone (AZ).
Private Subnets: Subnets without a route to an Internet Gateway (IGW) are considered private.
Public Subnets: Subnets with a route to an IGW are considered public.

3. Internet Gateway (IGW):🌐
Definition: An IGW is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet.
Usage: It is typically attached to public subnets to enable internet access.

4. Route Tables:🚦
Definition: A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed.
Association: Each subnet is associated with a route table.
Default Route: A default route (0.0.0.0/0) is typically associated with an IGW for public subnets and a NAT gateway or NAT instance for private subnets.


5. Network ACLs (NACLs):🧩
Definition: NACLs act as stateless firewalls at the subnet level, controlling inbound and outbound traffic.
Rule Evaluation: Rules are evaluated based on rule number, and the first matching rule is applied.

6. Security Groups:🔒
Definition: Security groups act as stateful firewalls at the instance level, controlling inbound and outbound traffic.
Rule Evaluation: All rules are evaluated, and traffic is allowed if there's a matching rule.

7. NAT Instances and NAT Gateways:🌐🚀
NAT Instance: A NAT instance is an EC2 instance that acts as a network address translator to enable instances in a private subnet to initiate outbound traffic to the internet.
NAT Gateway: A NAT gateway is a managed, highly available, and scalable service that performs network address translation for private subnet instances.

8. Peering:👥
Definition: VPC peering allows you to connect two VPCs to communicate with each other.
Limitations: VPC peering is not transitive (VPC A can't access VPC C through VPC B unless a direct peering connection is established).

9. VPC Endpoints:🌐⚡
Definition: VPC endpoints allow private connectivity to AWS services without going over the internet.
Types: There are two types - Gateway Endpoints (for S3 and DynamoDB) and Interface Endpoints (for other AWS services).

10. VPC Flow Logs:📊🔍
- Definition: VPC Flow Logs capture information about IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.
- Use Cases: Troubleshooting, security analysis, and compliance auditing.

11. VPC Best Practices:🛠️
- CIDR Blocks: Plan your IP address space carefully using CIDR blocks.
- Availability Zones: Deploy subnets across multiple Availability Zones for fault tolerance.
- Security: Use Security Groups and NACLs effectively.
- Routing: Set up routing tables and use NAT Gateways for private subnets.
- Naming Conventions: Use consistent and meaningful names for VPC resources.
- Flow Logs: Enable VPC Flow Logs for monitoring and security.

12. Advanced VPC Features:🚀🔗
